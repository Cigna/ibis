# Setup your IBIS

Follow the below 3 step:-

1. ## Download(clone) IBIS project

  
      Cloning the IBIS project to a specific folder
   
      ```git clone <repo> <directory>```

      Clone the repository located at <repo> into the folder called ~<directory>! on the local machine.


2. ## Run IBIS initial setup

      To prepare the IBIS Env(create the required directories, DB and tables used by IBIS), run Env setup shell<more infor to come here>

3. ## Build IBIS
     Build BIS project to create the egg, coverage report and the packaged ibis.tar.gz file containing egg with the required IBIS supporting files
   
     To build the code, navigate to the ibis_build folder and use the following command:
     
     ```sh build.sh <Argument1: ibis_home> <Argument2 : Execution option>```

     Argument 1 : Needs to be IBIS home directory path
     
     Argument 2 : Below are the acceptable argument values
```
         No arguments or leaving Blank will execute Test cases, Code check and Build process.
         skip-all-test - Skip all validation and create Egg
         skip-code-check - Skip code style check
         skip-build - Run all validations and skip build process
 ```        
 Refer [Test and Build](docs/test_and_build.md) for more details on building IBIS and running unit tests independently 

 
## IBIS Dependencies and prerequisites for IBIS setup

### 1. Installation requirements

- Unix like environment (Mac, Linux)

- Python 2.7.4 + requirements.pip

- graphviz dot (a yum install)

- Hadoop ecosystem (Oozie, Hive/Impala)

- Git repos

  - ibis (this one!)

  - request-files - Storing the request files for generating the IBIS workflows

  - ibis-workflows - Storing the workflows generated by IBIS



### 2. Back-end tables (Hive/Impala)

To create these tables, run: (created by initial setup step)
`/resources/ibis.hql`
